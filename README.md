# FlexForge Fitness PWA - Complete Development Guide

## üéØ Project Overview

---

## üöÄ Quick Start - For Developer

Follow these steps to get **FlexForge Fitness PWA** running locally:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

* Make sure you have Node.js **v22.4.0** and npm **10.8.1** installed.
* If you encounter errors related to package versions or peer dependencies, try:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

* If installation still fails, remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and run:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

* This project currently **does not require a backend or database**, so all dependencies are frontend-only.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
* The app supports **hot module replacement (HMR)** for live updates.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

* The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` folder.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Preview the production build

```bash
npm run preview
```

* Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) (or shown in terminal).

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Lint your code

```bash
npm run lint
```

* Automatically checks for formatting and code quality issues.
* Use `eslint . --fix` to auto-fix minor errors.

**Optional Notes**

* Recommended browsers: **Chrome, Firefox, Edge** (latest versions).
* For mobile testing, enable **device toolbar** in browser DevTools.
* No `.env` or backend setup is required for now.

---

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **`npm install` fails due to version mismatch**

   * Ensure Node.js is **v22.4.0** and npm is **10.8.1**.
   * Try:

     ```bash
     npm install --legacy-peer-deps
     ```

2. **`node_modules` issues**

   * Remove existing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`:

     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```

3. **Port conflicts**

   * If `vite` cannot start, ensure port **8000** is free or change the port:

     ```bash
     npm run dev -- --port 5174
     ```

4. **Browser caching issues**

   * Clear cache or use an incognito window for testing PWA changes.

5. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR) not updating**

   * Stop the dev server and restart:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

6. **Other Node/npm errors**

   * Update npm to the latest compatible version:

     ```bash
     npm install -g npm@10.8.1
     ```
   * Reinstall Node.js if necessary.

---

## üìù Notes

* The project is **frontend-only**: no API or database integration is needed.
* Designed as a **PWA**, supports offline usage.
* Ensure your system meets the **Node.js and npm versions** to avoid dependency issues.
